## Getting Started

To run the Rust web server locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the installation instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running and create a database for the project.
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
4. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your PostgreSQL database URL. For example:
     ```shell
     DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/server
     ```
5. Build and run the server using Cargo
     ```shell
     cargo run
     ```
6. The server should now be running on localhost:3000.
